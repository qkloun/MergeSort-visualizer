# Welcome
This project is a part of multiple similar projects that visualize the process of how algorithms sort data, this one would be showing how MergeSort would organize a set of data. 
It was made with sdl2, a c++ library which let me open up a window and visualize the whole process on the screen.

This project let me understand how the MergeSort algorithm organizes data in a visual representation, which let me further understand the complexities of sorting systems. This project furthered my experience in coding as I hadn't done anything similar to this before, so I would like to believe that this project would let other students process sorting algorithms more.
